# NightSky

This is my current Awesome WM. It's useable but still very WIP. I'm planning on
updating it as I use it.

### Latest screenshot:

## Dependencies

- [Rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/) - used for run menu
- [lua-yaml](http://luaforge.net/projects/yaml/) - used for parsing configuration files
- [acpi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acpiclient/files/acpiclient/) (optional) - battery status
- [light](https://github.com/haikarainen/light) (optional) - brightness
- [xflux](https://justgetflux.com/) (optional) - blue light reduction
- [pamixer](https://github.com/cdemoulins/pamixer) (optional) - volume control

All unmet optional dependencies are going to break smaller parts of
the configuration but the configuration should still load and work.
